## Overview


### Summary of Contributions

Overview: A short overview of your product to provide some context to the reader. The opening 1-2 sentences may be reused by all team members. If your product overview extends beyond 1-2 sentences, the remainder should be written by yourself.
Summary of Contributions --Suggested items to include:
Code contributed: Give a link to your code on tP Code Dashboard. The link is available in the Project List Page -- linked to the  icon under your profile picture.
Enhancements implemented: A summary of the enhancements you implemented.
Contributions to documentation: Which sections did you contribute to the UG?
Contributions to the DG: Which sections did you contribute to the DG? Which UML diagrams did you add/updated?
Contributions to team-based tasks :
Review/mentoring contributions: Links to PRs reviewed, instances of helping team members in other ways
Contributions beyond the project team:
Evidence of helping others e.g. responses you posted in our forum, bugs you reported in other team's products,
Evidence of technical leadership e.g. sharing useful information in the forum
Keep in mind that evaluators will use the PPP to estimate your project effort. We recommend that you mention things that will earn you a fair score e.g., explain how deep the enhancement is, why it is complete, how hard it was to implement etc..

[Optional] Contributions to the User Guide (Extracts): Reproduce the parts in the User Guide that you wrote. This can include features you implemented as well as features you propose to implement.
The purpose of allowing you to include proposed features is to provide you more flexibility to show your documentation skills. e.g. you can bring in a proposed feature just to give you an opportunity to use a UML diagram type not used by the actual features.
[Optional] Contributions to the Developer Guide (Extracts): Reproduce the parts in the Developer Guide that you wrote. Ensure there is enough content to evaluate your technical documentation skills and UML modelling skills. You can include descriptions of your design/implementations, possible alternatives, pros and cons of alternatives, etc.
