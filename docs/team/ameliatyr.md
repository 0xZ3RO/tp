## Overview
Within a time span of 7 weeks of hard work, we, a group of 5 enthusiatic NUS Computing students, proudly present to you our newest product, in the scope of CS2113T-Software Engineering and Object Oriented Programming module, **FLUFFLE**!

**FLUFFLE** is the writers swiss army knife of writing tools and idea organisation. While most writing applications focus on providing the user with a GUI they can type their story in, Fluffle caters specifically to creative writers, with various functions to help the creative process along and make the writing process spontaneous and smooth as possible.

### Enhancements implemented
Summary: Most of the enhancements I implemented for this product was for maintaining the Bunny list, as well as some UI components for aesthetics purposes.

####Bunny list enhancements

For context, a bunny is an idea that has yet to be fully written into a piece. The purpose of the bunnylist was to provide the creative writer using **Fluffle** store and organise these ideas, and to make it easy for user to find specific ideas. This was created to tackle the writers' problem of losing track of their loose ideas as they have too many ideas and no unified place to keep them.

####Aesthetic enhancements

I implemented the segment of the code that printed out the logo at the start of the application, as well as the functionality that enables the user to swap out the line dividers to one of the three options available. These components were an attempt to make the dull CLI look more entincing for the creative writer to use.

####Miscellaneous enhancements

I wrote the function description and explanations for the all the bunny related commands as well as the `divider` command listed by the help function, which helps the user recall the various commands while using the Fluffle. The only bunny related command I did not implement was the `reset bunny` command. While I did not implement the `reset bunny` command of the bunny list commands, I did the UG, DG and help segments for it.

### Contributions to documentation
In the UG,

### Contributions to the DG
: Which sections did you contribute to the DG? Which UML diagrams did you add/updated?

### Contributions to team-based tasks 
: Review/mentoring contributions: Links to PRs reviewed, instances of helping team members in other ways

## Contributions beyond the project team

### Evidence of helping others e.g. responses you posted in our forum, bugs you reported in other team's products,
### Evidence of technical leadership e.g. sharing useful information in the forum
Keep in mind that evaluators will use the PPP to estimate your project effort. We recommend that you mention things that will earn you a fair score e.g., explain how deep the enhancement is, why it is complete, how hard it was to implement etc..

## [Optional] 

### Contributions to the User Guide (Extracts)
: Reproduce the parts in the User Guide that you wrote. This can include features you implemented as well as features you propose to implement.
The purpose of allowing you to include proposed features is to provide you more flexibility to show your documentation skills. e.g. you can bring in a proposed feature just to give you an opportunity to use a UML diagram type not used by the actual features.
### Contributions to the Developer Guide (Extracts)
: Reproduce the parts in the Developer Guide that you wrote. Ensure there is enough content to evaluate your technical documentation skills and UML modelling skills. You can include descriptions of your design/implementations, possible alternatives, pros and cons of alternatives, etc.
